Construct Mvc-Skeleton application
==================================
 1. create Mvc-Skeleton folder
 2. in that folder: dotnet new web
 3. Rename the project MvcSkeleton
 4. Double-click on the project
    - that starts Visual Studio and makes a solution with the MvcSkeleton as its only project
 ---- Add Controllers Folder with Home Controller ----
 5. Right-click on the project > Add > New Folder > name folder "Controllers"
 6. Right-click on the folder > Add > New Class > name class HomeController.cs
 7. In that file add: using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
 8. Add a public method named index that returns a string "index invoked in HomeController"
 ---- Add Mvc service ----
 9. In Startup.cs add services.Mvc() to the Startup.ConfigureServices method
10. In Startup.cs add app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute(); in Startup.Configure
11. Start the application and you will see the default browser started and the index method response
    - the default route is localhost:44348/Home/index, so you don't need to supply /Home/index
12. Replace app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute() with the equivalent:
      app.UseMvc(routes =>
      {
        routes.MapRoute(
          name: "default",
          template: "{Controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"
        );
      });
13. Rerun the application to see that you get the same result.
